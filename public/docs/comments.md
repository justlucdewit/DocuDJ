# Comments
In Pea (and most other programming languages) comments are used to explain code to yourself and other people, and are ignored by the compiler. Pea comments are started with a `--` (double dash) and end at the end of the line.

Comments can be multiline, in which case they are started with `---` (tripple dash) and ended with the next `---`. **Multiline comments can not be nested**.

Comments can also be used to 'comment out code' which means you turn code into a comment to disable it.
